so i was thinking to change i dont know what i want to change tho i know i want to change 

ikd change can be +ve or -ve but i feel like i just want to stop time and just stay still for a while 
i feel this expecially when im reading for exams or doing some boring stuff like trying to memorize something 

I often think about how i want to change and become productive but when the time comes i just dont do anything 
i feel like im good only in my brain when it comes to execute those abstract ideas i just cant do it i feel so lazy 
and uninterested about everything 

so sometimes it makes me think that im just avoiding those boring stuff tagging them as boring cause i just cant or 
dont want to do them for example i feel like i dont want to study for these exams cause its just the test of memory 
nothing more but is it really it or i just cant/dont wnat to read for that exam thats why i tag it like that and leave 
it is it just one of my excueses to be lazy but i feel like if i do something which i find fun then life wont be so sad 
and boring 

also i have recently realised that i wont fit in into the regular 9-5 system im just not that type of guy 
i mean all this time constraint feels like a chain to me i want freedom i want to be free form everything ig 
but do i really want freedom or im just trying to avoid the work which i should do ?
