I have been thinking how its so smooth to fall into rat race i always wanted to build something on my own but i feel like im just chasing the rat race making projects which look good just on resume for internships even if i dont really like to work on these projects im spending more time trying to become someone who can get a job i think i want to change this 

But how?

Im still figuring it out ig i dont really have deep knowledge in any of the tech field yet but I think its just a excuese 

Im thinking of taking very small steps towards whatever im trying to do, I do like the idea of exploring but I also get impatient when the results are not to my liking
